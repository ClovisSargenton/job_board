# job_board

## Introduction

This is the very first project I have done at epitech with my pair Corentin Sarlin using Node.js and Express.js as a REST API for the backend.<br /> 
It's a Job Board website allowing users to create an account,<br />
posting and managing advertisements (updating and deleting it), and of course, applying to it.<br />
Permissions are not the same depending on the level of the user (applicant, recruiter or admin).<br />


## How to run it?

In order to run this project you will need an apache server for the front end, and mysql installed<br />
for the database.<br />
You will also need to run "npm install" inside the "./backend/" directory in order to install the required<br />
dependencies.<br />
Connection to mysql database is made under "./backend/public/javascript/phpMyAdmin.js".<br />
